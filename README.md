lifx-wakeup
===========

This is a sunrise alarm for the lifx smart lightbulb. 

You could install this on a homeserver, raspberry pi, NAS, basicly everything that is able to run nodeJS. I run a cron job every morning 20 minutes before I wake up. The cron job will rise the alarm slowly until it is time to wake up.
